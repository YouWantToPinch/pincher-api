Pincher is a webserver that hosts manual budgeting tools designed for meticulous control in a zero-based approach to personal finance.

### Development Tools
Under the `/tools/` directory, one might find a bash 
script, `build_test.sh`. This script (which depends on 
[github.com/charmbracelet/gum)) can be used to easily 
generate tests for the pincher-api webserver.

The resultings tests are 
built to fit the specs of 
those functions already defined 
within `/tests/functions.
