## Contributing

Your desire to contribute to the project is appreciated!

As of now, there are no clear guidelines to follow, as the project is rather fresh, but be sure that:

1. You use the standard [Go formatter](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt)
2. You rebase your local changes onto any remote branch you are pulling when you use `git pull`, rather than making any unnecessary merge commits; they befoul the git history! You can always set up a local git configuration to handle this automatically with: `git config pull.rebase true`.

If there is an issue posted that you would like to take on, just ask underneath it and we can discuss your potential contribution to the project.
